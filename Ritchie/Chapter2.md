1.Limits
------
The various limits for data types are stored in the <limits.h> header. For float, the limits are stored in <float.h>

[Data Limits](limits.c)

Otherwise if we know the bit size, the ranges can be computed as well. For e.g. if char is of 8 bytes then for signed char the range will be -2^7 to 2^7-1
